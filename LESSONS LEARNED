Lessons Learned:
*******************************************************************************
Heroku Deployment - Sinatra app:

	Need to inculde Sinatra in the config.ru ('Rack up') file - see Heroku article:
	https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack

	"To run a Rack-based app, include a Gemfile, as well as a rackup file named config.ru in the appâ€™s root directory. The config.ru file convention has become common, so most existing Rack applications should not require changes to deploy to Heroku."

	config.ru:
		require './hello'
		run Sinatra::Application

*******************************************************************************
Sinatra - Public Folder:
	Sinatra expects static files to be placed int he public forlder. ie: somefile.css
	This is not intuitive since they are referenced like they are in the top level directory:
		<!-- suspicious lack of "public/somefile.css" -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="somefile.css" />
*******************************************************************************
JQuery - loading:
	Load jQuery before the JavaScript file:
		<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    	<script type = "text/javascript" src="j-cafe.js"></script>
*******************************************************************************
(document).ready();
	Used because the brower reads line by line. So if javascript is loaded in <head>, it won't be able to access any of the elelments in the <body> because they dont' exist yet. 
*******************************************************************************
Input Buttons: 
	<input type="submit" name="submit" class="button" id="submit_btn" value="Order" />  
	Atrributes:
		type - The type of control to display. The default type is text, if this attribute is not specified.
		name - The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data.

*******************************************************************************
Variable scope: variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed outside of the function.
	I was having trouble with my totalcost variable because I placed it outside function associated with the on event.
