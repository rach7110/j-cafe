Heroku Deployment - Sinatra app:

	Need to inculde Sinatra in the config.ru ('Rack up') file - see Heroku article:
	https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack

	"To run a Rack-based app, include a Gemfile, as well as a rackup file named config.ru in the appâ€™s root directory. The config.ru file convention has become common, so most existing Rack applications should not require changes to deploy to Heroku."

	config.ru:
		require './hello'
		run Sinatra::Application
